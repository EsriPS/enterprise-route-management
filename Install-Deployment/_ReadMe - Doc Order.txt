For a new deployment, perform the install processes in the following sequence:

1. ERM Environment Setup Guide.docx
2. ERM Application Deployment Guide.docx
3. ERM Workforce Deployment Guide.docx (optional)
4. ERM Dashboard Deployment Guide.docx (optional)

#3 Workforce and #4 Dashboard are independent of each other, can be installed in either order or only one. 
But #1 Envrionment and #2 Application needs to be run before either.
